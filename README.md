Collenchyma provides a common Rust interface to run operations on potentially
Cuda or OpenCL supported machines, making deployment of high-performance code as
easy and platform-agnostic as common code.

Collenchyma's abstracts over the different computation languages (Native,
OpenCL, Cuda) and let's you run highly-performant code, thanks to easy
parallelization, on servers, desktops or mobiles without the need to adapt your
code for the machine you deploy to. Collenchyma does not require OpenCL or Cuda
on the machine and automatically falls back to the native host CPU, making your
application highly flexible and fast to build.

Collenchyma was started at [Autumn][autumn] to support the Machine Intelligence
Framework [Leaf][leaf] with backend-agnostic, state-of-the-art performance.

* __Parallelizing Performance__<br/>
Collenchyma makes it easy to parallelize computations on your machine, putting
all the available cores of your CPUs/GPUs to use.
Collenchyma also provides optimized operations for the most popular operations,
such as BLAS, that you can use right away to speed up your application.
Highly-optimized computation libraries like open-BLAS and cuDNN can be dropped
in.

* __Easily Extensible__<br/>
Writing custom operations for GPU execution becomes easier with Collenchyma, as
it already takes care of Framework peculiarities, memory management and other
overhead. Therefore extending the Backend becomes a straight-forward process of
defining the kernels and mounting them on the Backend.

* __Butter-smooth Builds__<br/>
As Collenchyma does not require the installation of various frameworks and
libraries, it will not add significantly to the build time of your application.
Collenchyma checks at run-time if these frameworks can be used and gracefully
falls back to the standard, native host CPU if they are not.
No long and painful build procedures for you or your users.

## Getting Started

If you're using Cargo, just add Collenchyma to your Cargo.toml:

    [dependencies]
    collenchyma = "0.0.3"

If you're using [Cargo Edit][cargo-edit], you can call:

    $ cargo add collenchyma

[cargo-edit]: https://github.com/killercup/cargo-edit

## Examples

Backend with custom defined Framework and Device.

```
extern crate collenchyma as co;
use co::framework::IFramework;
use co::backend::{Backend, BackendConfig};
use co::frameworks::Native;
fn main() {
   let framework = Native::new(); // Initialize the Framework
   let hardwares = framework.hardwares(); // Now you can obtain a list of available hardware for that Framework.
   // Create the custom Backend by providing a Framework and one or many Hardwares.
   let backend_config = BackendConfig::new(framework, hardwares);
   let backend = Backend::new(backend_config);
   // You can now execute all the operations available, e.g.
   // backend.dot(x, y);
 }
```
Machine-agnostic Backend.

```
extern crate collenchyma as co;
use co::framework::IFramework;
use co::backend::{Backend, BackendConfig};
use co::frameworks::Native;
fn main() {
    // Not yet implemented.
    // No need to provide a Backend Configuration.
    let backend = Backend::new(None);
    // You can now execute all the operations available, e.g.
    // backend.dot(x, y);
}
```
